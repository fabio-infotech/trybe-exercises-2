# 3.3. HTML & CSS - Selectors and Positioning
Today's content was a continuation of yesterday's introdiction to CSS. We were directed to do a part of [Khan Academy's intro to CSS](https://pt.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics) and told to do the specific challenges presented here. All challenge results are put in this folder as _.html_ files.

## Challenge 1: Group the groupers (CSS Grouping Elements)

This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding `<span>` tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your `<span>` tags a class called "first-sentence". 
Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.
Wrap the paragraphs in a single `<div>`, and then give the div a class of "info".
Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.

## Challenge 2: The overflowing ocean (CSS Width, Height and Overflow)

This webpage describes the ocean, with an image and a few paragraphs which are inside a `<div>`. Style the `<div>` that has a class of 'info', so that it takes up 70% of the width and is 200px tall. Now, make it so the div cuts off the overflowing text and presents a scrollbar instead. Write a CSS rule for the ‘pic’ class that resizes the image to take up the same width as the text.


## Challenge 3: The boxer model (CSS Box Model)

This webpage displays a gallery of photos of boxer dogs. In this first step, add a border to all of the photos. Try and make it look like a photo frame, if you can. The photos look a bit too close to each other. Add margin to them, either on all sides or just the sides that matter to separate them. The photos are too close to the side of the gallery div, and it looks weird. Add padding around all sides of the gallery div so that it looks better.

## Challenge 4: Position planet (CSS Positioning)

This webpage contains an image of a planet, an image of a creature, and a div with a greeting. Your job is to make it look like the creature is sitting on the planet and saying the greeting. In this first step, use absolute positioning to put the creature on top of the planet somewhere. Then, position the greeting on top of the planet as well.
