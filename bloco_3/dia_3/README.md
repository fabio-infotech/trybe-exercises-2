# 3.3. HTML & CSS - Selectors and Positioning
Today's content was a continuation of yesterday's introdiction to CSS. We were directed to do a parte of [Khan Academy's intro to CSS](https://pt.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics) and told to do the specific challenges presented here. All challenge results are put in this folder as _.html_ files.

## Challenge 1: Group the groupers (CSS Grouping Elements)

This webpage describes groupers, a type of large ocean fish. In the first step, your job is to to make the first sentences of each paragraph stand out. Start by adding `<span>` tags around each first sentence. Then give both of your `<span>` tags a class called "first-sentence".
Now, using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your "first-sentence" class. Make the sentence either bold, or underlined.
Wrap the paragraphs in a single `<div>`, and then give the div a class of "info".
Using a class selector, write a CSS rule to style your 'info' class. Give it a cool looking background color.
