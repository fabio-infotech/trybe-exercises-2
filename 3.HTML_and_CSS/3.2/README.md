**3.2. HTML & CSS - CSS First steps**
Today's content was about CSS basics. We were directed to do [Khan Academy's intro to CSS](https://pt.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics) and told to do specific challenges amongst the ones presented there. All challenge results are posted here as _.html_ files.

***Challenge 1: Colorful creature (CSS Basics)***

Let's have you make a webpage about an awesome animal, and color the webpage to look like it.

***Challenge 2: Seasonal ids (CSS: Selecting by id)***

This webpage describes the favorite seasons of Olaf, a sun-loving snowman. Both of the `<h2>`'s have id's, but there are no CSS rules for styling them yet. Add 2 rules that color the headings.

***Challenge 3: Apples and bananas classes***

This webpage displays the lyrics for a song about apples and bananas. There are already classes on most of the words about apples and bananas, but there is no style for those classes yet. Add two style rules, one that sets a color for the 'apples' class and another that sets a color for the 'bananas' class.

The final line of the song has no classes on the `<strong>` tags! Add the 'apples' class to the first `<strong>` in that line, and the 'bananas' class to the second `<strong>` in it.

***Challenge 4: Change the font families***

This webpage displays the theme songs from a few famous TV families. Each of the lyrics paragraphs have id's, but the CSS rules for them have no properties yet. Add a font-family property to each of the CSS rules, using a generic family name that works for all computers. Choose a different font family for each rule.

Use the body selector to make a new CSS rule that changes the font-family of the entire page.
