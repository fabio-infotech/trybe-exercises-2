**3.2. HTML & CSS - CSS First steps**
Today's content was about CSS basics. We were directed to do [Khan Academy's intro to CSS](https://pt.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics) and told to do specific challenges amongst the ones presented there. All challenge results are posted here as _.html_ files.

Let's have you make a webpage about an awesome animal, and color the webpage to look like it.

***Challenge 2: Seasonal ids (CSS: Selecting by id)***

This webpage describes the favorite seasons of Olaf, a sun-loving snowman. Both of the h2's have id's, but there are no CSS rules for styling them yet. Add 2 rules that color the headings.
